## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Most of my challenges were actually with changing the UI. I had difficulties with resetting the theme colors, finding an appealing color scheme, and changing fonts. 
The tutorials were simple to follow, and I was able to adapt what I had learned with the buttons to create the clear button.
